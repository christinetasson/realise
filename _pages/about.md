#### Abstract
Whatever the context (robots, planes or computer assisted cars) embedded software have to react in real
time and to adapt to their continuously evolving environment. Moreover, such critical softwares have to en-
sure strong safety properties. That is why the computer science community has been developing dedicated
programming languages so called reactive and synchronous. Nowadays, reactive languages have to include
modern approaches such as Artificial Intelligence. Indeed, statistical models can model physical environment
and be used for training controllers in reactive systems. Over the last years, many probabilistic programming
languages have been introduced in order to describe statistical models. The probabilistic paradigm has raised
new challenges for the computer science community and turned to be a rich and trendy line of research. For in-
stance, at IBM research - one of the largest industrial research organizations in the world - the AI Programming
Models team is working in collaboration with MIT and DIENS on robust and reactive probabilistic modeling.
