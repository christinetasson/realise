#### Abstract

Embedded software flies planes and drives autonomous cars, control robots and
monitor health devices. This success makes the challenge faced by its developers
tougher than ever, as they must write code that is able to react in real time to
a shifting physical environment under stringent safety constraints.

To address the difficulties posed by safety-critical embedded software, the
computer science community has been developing dedicated programming languages,
the so-called reactive and synchronous languages. Such languages enforce strong
safety properties by construction, e.g., by ruling out deadlocks statically.

New application domains such as autonomous driving require integrating
techniques from artificial intelligence to reactive programming frameworks. For
example, statistical models of physical environments can be used for training
controllers written in reactive languages. While computer languages for
statistical and probabilistic programming have been studied in depth by the
academic and industrial community, their application to the reactive setting is
still in its infancy.

The **ReaLiSe** project will study the integration of probabilistic and
statistical programming with reactive and synchronous languages. We will adopt
both practical and theoretical point-of-views, combining the strengths of
academic and industrial partners. We will build on top of existing efforts, such
as the work of the //AI Programming Models// team of IBM research -- one of the
largest industrial research organizations in the world -- in collaboration with
MIT and DIENS on robust and reactive probabilistic modeling.
